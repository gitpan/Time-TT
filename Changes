    realisation names that include non-ASCII digits

  * document standard Time::TT::Realisation methods in
    Time::TT::InterpolatingRealisation

  * document standard Math::Interpolator::Knot methods in

  * in documentation, use "^" instead of "**" to signify exponentiation

  * in Time::TT::OffsetKnot, abandon use of the "fields" module

  * POD markup fix

  * use full stricture in test suite

  * test POD syntax and coverage, and rename some internal functions to
    satisfy the coverage test
