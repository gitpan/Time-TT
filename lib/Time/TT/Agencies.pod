Time::TT::Agencies - list of Terran horological agencies

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Precision timekeeping on Terra is a complex task undertaken by a group of
about seventy agencies around the planet, mostly national metrological
laboratories.  The time scales that they produce are conventionally
labelled using short abbreviations, mostly of two to four letters,
identifying the agency concerned.  This document lists the abbreviations
and their meanings.

The BIPM maintains a similar list at
L<ftp://ftp2.bipm.fr/pub/tai/publication/acronyms.txt>, but that only
includes current laboratory abbreviations, and does not include special
cases such as GPS.  The list below is more complete.
